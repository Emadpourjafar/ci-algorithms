## Description:
The car tries to go through a race track and not hit the walls with only two frontal sensors and tries to compensate the minimal input given to it with help of its neural network.

## How to Run the Project:
To run the project, you just need (JRE, JDK)
The project has been tested with JDK 13 and eclipse. But no special feature of JDK 13 was used on the project, so it probably can work with other JDK versions and IDEs.
For start go to the `Sketch` class and run the program.
