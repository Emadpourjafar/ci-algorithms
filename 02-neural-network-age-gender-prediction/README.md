## Description:
At first the pre requirements of the project such as OpenCV library for Python and Numpy was downloaded.
Then, using command prompt and pip command they were installed in the Python package.
After finishing the installation of pre requirements it's time to jump into coding and implementing the project.
So, using webcam pictures will be captured continuously and changed to gray scale form,
 then using OpenCV's methods, faces, gender and age of the faces will be calculated and printed in the output.
 The goal of changing picture into gray scale form is to simplify comparison of the contradictions in the picture.

 ## The requirements for configuration:
- opencv==3.3.0
- numpy==1.14.0
- imutils==0.4.6
- pip install OpenCV-python
- numpy
- pip install pafy
- pip install youtube_dl (to know more about youtube_dl)
