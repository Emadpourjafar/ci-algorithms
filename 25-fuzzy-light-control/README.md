## Descreption:
The Project was about designing a fuzzy system to control light iin smart homes. our constants in this project was a 200m^2 House, that we should keep in in 200 Lux lights, to do this, we need 500W Lamps.

our input is from a sensor that gives us the house lighting measure in LUX, and our output is how many Lamps should be turned On.
